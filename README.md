This is a rails app which allows users to:
* Enter desired dates / airports and click “Search”
* Choose from among a list of available flights
* Enter passenger information for all passengers

This app makes use of:
* a PostgreSQL database
* simple-form gem

I hope to gain more familiarity with:
* Rails associations
* the simple-form gem
